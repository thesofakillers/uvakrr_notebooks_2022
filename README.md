# UvA - KRR - Q1 2022 - Jupyter Notebooks

Notebooks from UvA's KRR course, Q1 2022 edition.

Please refer to this mapping for titles:

```JSON
{
  "using SAT in Python": "week2/sat.ipynb",
  "Exercise 3 of Exercise Session 2": "week2/ex2.ipynb",
  "using ASP in Python": "week3/asp.ipynb",
  "Exercise 2 of Exercise Session 3 (with solutions)": "week3/ex3-with-solutions.ipynb",
  "modelling tricks in ASP": "week4/asp-tricks.ipynb",
  "guide to ASP": "week4/guide-to-asp.ipynb",
  "explanation of saturation": "week5/saturation.ipynb",
  "checking uniqueness of solutions in ASP": "week5/unique-solution.ipynb"
}
```

And to the following tree diagram:

```stdout
.
├── README.md
├── week2
│   ├── ex2.ipynb
│   └── sat.ipynb
├── week3
│   ├── asp.ipynb
│   └── ex3-with-solutions.ipynb
├── week4
│   ├── asp-tricks.ipynb
│   └── guide-to-asp.ipynb
└── week5
    ├── saturation.ipynb
    └── unique-solution.ipynb

4 directories, 9 files
```

Note: these are mainly re-uploads from canvas for my own convenience (e.g. being
able to preview them without running Jupyter Lab). The notebooks will probably
be for the most part incomplete.
